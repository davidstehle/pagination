Description
-----------
Replace “previous page” and “next page” links with numbered page links.

Installation
-----------
Install in just two simple steps!

1. Copy/paste code snippet into your WordPress theme's “functions.php” file.
2. Style to your liking with CSS.

*NOTE: Every theme has a functions file stored in the theme's subdirectory, wp-content/themes. Most themes commonly name the functions file “functions.php”. But your theme may name your functions file something slightly different. For example, in Thesis 1.x it’s named “custom_functions.php” and in Thesis 2.x it’s named “custom.php”. Regardless of the name variation, both refer to your functions file.*

**Q) Where can I get more help?**<br>

**Q) I’d rather use a plugin. What do you recommend?**<br>
If you don’t like getting your hands dirty with code, I highly recommend using the [WP-PageNavi] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pagenavi) plugin. Super easy, very stable, and a great alternative.
